		<h2>Earlier Life</h2>
		<p>Shane Warne grew up in Victoria, Australia, and showed a keen interest in sports from a young age.His mother was German. He attended Hampton High School from Grades 7–9 before being offered a sports scholarship to
            attend Mentone Grammar, where he spent his final three years of school. He started playing cricket at the age of eight and later played Australian rules football as well. Warne dropped out of school at the age of
            16 to focus on his cricket career.
        </p>
        <br>

		<h2>Earlier Career</h2>
		<p>Warne made his first-class debut for Victoria in 1990 and soon became a regular in the team. He made his Test debut for Australia in 1992 against India and took a wicket in his first over. Warne's first major success
            came in the 1993 Ashes series against England, where he took 34 wickets in six Tests.Warne's first representative honours came in the 1983–84 season when he represented University of Melbourne Cricket Club in the 
            Victorian Cricket Association's under-16 Dowling Shield competition.<br> 
            <br>He bowled a mixture of leg-spin and off-spin, and was a handy lower-order batsman.The following season, Warne joined St Kilda Cricket Club, which is located near his home suburb Black Rock.
            He started in the lower elevens and, over a number of seasons, progressed to the first eleven. During the cricket off-season in 1987, Warne played five games of Australian rules football for St Kilda Football Club's
            under-19 team. In 1988, Warne again played for the St Kilda Football Club's under-19 team before being promoted to the reserves team, one step below professional level. Following the 1988 Victorian Football 
            League season, St Kilda delisted Warne and he began to focus solely on cricket. In 1990, Warne was chosen to train at the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide.<br>
            <br>In 1991, Warne moved to the UK and joined Accrington 
            Cricket Club of the Lancashire League as their professional player for that year's cricket season. After initially struggling in English conditions, he had a good season as a bowler, taking 73 wickets at 15.4 runs
            each but scored only 329 runs at an average of 15. The committee at Accrington decided not to re-engage Warne for the 1992 season because they expected their professional to contribute as both a batsman and bowler.
        </p>

		<h2>Domestic Career</h2>
		<p>Aside from playing for Victoria, Warne also played for the Rajasthan Royals and the Melbourne Stars in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL), respectively. He was one of the key players for both

           to spin the ball prodigiously and deceive even the best batsmen in the world.
        </p>

        <br>

		<h2>Twenty20 Career</h2>

            captain of the Rajasthan Royals. He led the team to victory in the tournament, and his performance earned him the title of Player of the Series. Warne also played in the BBL for the Melbourne Stars and was a key player for
